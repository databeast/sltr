## SLTR - a Dependency Tool for Golang

Except, it isn't because no such tool exists. You've likely found this page because you've seen the tool mentioned in a GOlang job description you were sent. 

The truth of the matter is that the technical requirements for that job posting have been copy-and-pasted for years now, by lazy recruiters and employers who haven't done the time to do their research, and just lazily copied the first google hits they found. 

It's not a gap in your GO knowledge, Sltr doesn't exist, has never existed.
